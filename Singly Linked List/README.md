# Singly Linked List

## What is a Singly Linked List?

A Singly Linked List is a sequence of nodes where each node has a **value** and a **next** pointer.

## Real-Life Uses
* Implementation of stacks and queues

* Undo functionality in applications

* Memory-efficient dynamic arrays

## Key Lines of Code
```
self.head = Node(data)  # Creating the first node
self.next = Node(data)  # Linking the next node
```
This structure allows efficient insertions and deletions without memory reallocation, unlike arrays.

## How to Run
Save the Python script and execute it using:
```
python singlylinkedlist.py
```

## Example Output
```
Singly Linked List: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
